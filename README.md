Provenance Aerospace adds Blue Origin parts to KSP. Currently New Glenn, Blue Moon, and New Shepard are all that are planned for the mod, but once we get images of New Armstrong and New Lindbergh I'd be more than happy to add them.
Special thanks to:

Superpenguin160 for the amazing BE-4 Engine

CobaltWolf for the modeling and texturing help

Zorg for the help with balancing

JadeOfMaar for the plumes
